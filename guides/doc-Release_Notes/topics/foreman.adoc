== Headline Features

=== Redis cache can now be managed by the installer

By default Foreman uses a file-based cache on tmpfs, but Foreman 2.1 added
support for Redis caching. Rails mentions that the file-based cache should not
be used in production. There are known issues with (very) large installations
with loads of concurrent requests.

Now switching over is as easy as `foreman-installer --foreman-rails-cache-store type:redis`.
This will likely become the default in a future version.

=== New installations will disable Puppetserver's telemetry by default

The Foreman project has always taken a position where we want to respect user's
privacy and telemetry goes against that. Puppetserver 7 has started to send
telemetry by default.

Foreman 3.4 introduced an installer parameter to disable it
(`--puppet-server-puppetserver-telemetry false`), but it kept the Puppetserver built in default.

The Foreman installer will now default to disabling telemetry for new
installations. Upgrading users will need to explicitly disable telemetry.

For more information, see
https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/server/puppet_server_usage_telemetry.html[Puppetserver's telementry documentation].

=== Foreman Ansible plug-in

==== New option to enable the callback plugin for Ansible jobs

Previously, the callback plug-in was enabled only for the `Ansible Roles - Ansible Default` playbook.
In this release, a new feature has been added, giving users the ability to enable the callback plug-in for each Ansible job template individually.
