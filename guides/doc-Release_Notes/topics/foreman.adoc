=== {awx} Parameter Change
The `ansible_tower_fqdn` parameter has been removed and replaced with `ansible_tower_api_url`. This new parameter includes both the previous `ansible_tower_fqdn` value and the required API path for {awx}.

By default, the API path is set to `/api/controller/v2`. If you are using an older version of {awx} that requires a different API path, you will need to update it manually to `/api/v2`.
